# Hey, I'm Alessandro ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Computer Science student interested in how things work **behind the scenes**.  
I enjoy building systems, experimenting with databases, and digging into backend logic that powers applications.  
Most of my projects are ways for me to learn by doing, and I like exploring different approaches to problem-solving.  

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Exploring  
- Backend development and server-side logic  
- Database design and management  
- Writing cleaner, more efficient code
